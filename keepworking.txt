Many of you might have seen people typing very fast? isn't. 
and sometimes you may have thought to type fast.
i know everyone of us do so. 
and beleive me its very easy to be good at typing. Even, you can also learn different languages to type.

little finger on A, ring finger on S, middle finger on D, index finger on F, 
for right hand, 
Little finger on ;, ring finger on L, middle finger on K, index finger on J.
